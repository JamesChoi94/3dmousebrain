We used the [BrainGlobe Initiative's](https://brainglobe.info) suite of software of interoperable Python-based tools for the analysis and visualization the data.

### Brainreg
For the registration of brain images to [Allen Reference Atlas](https://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas), we used [brainreg](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg).

### Cell Finder
[Cellfinder](https://brainglobe.info/cellfinder) is software from the Margrie Lab at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UCL for automated 3D cell detection and registration of whole-brain images.

### Brainrender
After registering data to the Allen Reference Atlas, we used [brainrender](https://docs.brainrender.info) to render images in 3D.

For more details on adapting the captured serial 2D images from the light-sheet microscope into computational neuroanatomy using the BrainGlobe Initiative's tools, see the Materials and Methods section from the original manuscript.
